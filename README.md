# ☁️ AWS Cloud Security Lab
## 📊 Project Highlights

- ☁️ AWS CloudTrail Log Analysis
- 🔍 API Activity Monitoring
- 🧠 Cloud Threat Detection & Investigation
- 📂 IAM & S3 Security Analysis
- 🧬 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- ⚔️ Cloud Attack Simulation (Attacker → Defender)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a hands-on Cloud Security Lab designed to simulate a real-world AWS account compromise and demonstrate detection and investigation using CloudTrail and Splunk.

Each attack scenario follows a structured workflow:

- ⚔️ Attack Simulation (API-based)
- 📥 CloudTrail Log Collection
- 🔍 Detection & Analysis (Splunk / CloudTrail)
- 🧬 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- 🛡️ Mitigation & Hardening
## 🧪 Lab Environment

| Component | Description |
